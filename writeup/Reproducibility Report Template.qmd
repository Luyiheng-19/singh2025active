<!-- Reproducibility reports should all use this template to standardize reporting across projects. These reports will be public supplementary materials that accompany the summary report(s) of the aggregate results. -->

## Introduction

[No abstract is needed.]  Each reproducibility project will have a straightforward, no frills report of the study and reproducibility results. These reports will be publicly available as supplementary material for the aggregate report(s) of the project as a whole.  Also, to maximize project integrity, the intro and methods will be written and critiqued in advance of your attempt to reproduce the results. Introductions can be just 1-2 paragraphs clarifying the main idea of the original study, the target finding for your reproducibility attempt, and any other essential information.  It will NOT have a literature review -- that is in the original publication. You can write both the introduction and the methods in past tense.  

**Clarify key analysis of interest here**  You can also pre-specify additional analyses you plan to do.

### Justification for choice of study

I choose a recent paper from my advisor. I will try to replicate experiment in the figure 6 (especially the figure 6C). Figure 6C is part of a study analyzing gaze behavior in freely moving marmosets wearing the CEREBRO head-mounted eye-tracking system. The experiment involves recording marmosets as they freely explore a large open arena (200 cm × 100 cm × 240 cm). The goal of the experiment is to test the relations of eye movement and head movement. During this exploration, the system simultaneously records. CERBRO in this paper is an effective device that can collect eye-tracking data in free-moving marmoset. In my project, I will also use CERBRO and record the data from free-moving systems and research questions of specific tasks (e.g. social interactions).My research interest stands on natural visual behavior of the marmoset, so get to familiar with the eye-tracking data collected by this device is helpful for me to do research. 

### Anticipated challenges

Firstly is to extract eye-tracking data, and detect eye behaviors,  use a gaze velocity threshold (e.g., ±200°/s) to classify epochs into Gaze shifts(when gaze velocity exceeds the threshold) and Gaze fixations (when gaze velocity is below the threshold). For each time point during the recorded session. Secondly, plot horizontal eye velocity (or position change) on the y-axis and head yaw velocity (or position change) on the x-axis, use a scatter plot to visualize the relationship, with distinct colors for each epoch.. Then, compute the correlation coefficient between eye and head movements separately for fixation and shift epochs.
Challenge: I think the data may be raw data, so it is difficult to Organize and clean the data. And simulate the data also a challenge because the data is complex. The correct visualization of gaze trajectory is also a challenge.

## Methods

### Description of the steps required to reproduce the results

Please describe all the steps necessary to reproduce the key result(s) of this study. 

### Differences from original study

Explicitly describe known differences in the analysis pipeline between the original paper and yours (e.g., computing environment). The goal, of course, is to minimize those differences, but differences may occur. Also, note whether such differences are anticipated to influence your ability to reproduce the original results.

## Project Progress Check 1

### Measure of success

Please describe the outcome measure for the success or failure of your reproduction and how this outcome will be computed.


### Pipeline progress

Earlier in this report, you described the steps necessary to reproduce the key result(s) of this study. Please describe your progress on each of these steps (e.g., data preprocessing, model fitting, model evaluation).


## Results

*Side-by-side graph with original graph is ideal here*

### Exploratory analyses

Any follow-up analyses desired (not required).  

## Discussion

### Summary of Reproduction Attempt

Open the discussion section with a paragraph summarizing the primary result from the key analysis and assess whether you successfully reproduced it, partially reproduced it, or failed to reproduce it.  

### Commentary

Add open-ended commentary (if any) reflecting (a) insights from follow-up exploratory analysis of the dataset, (b) assessment of the meaning of the successful or unsuccessful reproducibility attempt - e.g., for a failure to reproduce the original findings, are the differences between original and present analyses ones that definitely, plausibly, or are unlikely to have been moderators of the result, and (c) discussion of any objections or challenges raised by the current and original authors about the reproducibility attempt (if you contacted them).  None of these need to be long.
